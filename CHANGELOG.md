## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **WP0.7 — Compiler interface + offline regression harness.** `CompilerProtocol`
  with `FixtureCompiler` (offline, slug→`fixtures/compiler/{slug}.json`) and
  `AnthropicCompiler` (live, CLI `--live` only; lazy `anthropic` import; never
  imported by tests). `postprocess.extract_json` (fence-strip + outermost-`{}` +
  parse); `prompt_v1` (`compile-world-v1.0`, JSON-only + fictional-entities rule);
  `pipeline.process` (validate→clamp→construct). 50 checked-in fixtures
  (`scripts/gen_fixtures.py`): 40 valid, 5 clamp, 5 reject — harness asserts valid+
  clamp build and run 12+ months, clamp records clamps, reject is rejected.
- **WP0.6 — Stores + digest.** `core/digest.py`: canonical JSON (sorted keys,
  compact, shortest-round-trip floats) and SHA-256 over float64 path tensors rounded
  to 12 decimals (`digest_paths`, `digest_ensemble`). `store/db.py`: SQLite (WAL,
  foreign keys) with `worlds`, `run_records`, `chronicle` tables and append-only
  chronicle triggers. `store/worlds.py`: engine-field immutability (edits under an
  existing world_id are rejected; narrative/provenance edits allowed in place).
  `store/runrecords.py`: save/get + `verify_run` (recompute digest from stored
  world+seed and compare) — tamper of stored digest or world is detected.
  `store/chronicle.py`: append/read only (no mutators), trigger-enforced at the DB.
- **WP0.5 — Institution simulator + decisions.** `simulate_institution(paths,
  decisions)` runs the start mix through an engine path with annual decision points
  (month `12*year-1`, years 1-9) and actions `hold|derisk|leanin|secondary`
  (10pt growth↔defensive shifts preserving proportions; secondary sells ≤8pts PE at
  0.82 with a total haircut and a pe→bonds target move). Returns are read as percent
  with per-sleeve limited liability, so weights sum to 1 and no sleeve goes negative
  by construction. `hold_course_twin` (passive benchmark) and `decision_alpha`
  (active − twin). Golden hold-course value + hypothesis invariants.

### Changed
- **Engine (WP0.4) HY spread-shock scaling.** WP0.5 surfaced that the HY
  `3.5·Δspread` term used Δspread in bps, producing ±300%/month returns; the spread
  path is bps but that coefficient only yields sane monthly returns with Δspread in
  percentage points. Δspread is now converted bps→pp; HY is now ±6-9%/month, in line
  with its own vol term and every other asset. The WP0.4 golden digest was
  regenerated accordingly.

### Added (earlier)
- **WP0.4 — Deterministic toy engine (`toy-v0`).** Monthly, pure-function engine
  (`run_path`, `run_ensemble`) over a `NumericWorld`: policy-rate AR path, HY-spread
  rise/decay, inflation AR, binary crisis mask, common-factor asset returns, and
  quarterly appraisal-smoothed reported marks for pe/pc/re. All randomness from one
  `Generator(PCG64(seed))`, drawn up front in fixed order; ensemble seeds
  `base_seed + 7919*k`; errors clearly on non-`toy-v0` generators. Tests: frozen
  golden digest (seed 42 stagflation), determinism, hypothesis invariants
  (finite / rate>=0.1 / spread>=150 / reported flat off quarter-ends), ensemble
  seeding, and the narrative-blindness guard (now access-pattern based).
- **WP0.3 — Validator (V-rules).** `validate(world) -> ValidationResult`
  {clamped_world, clamps, warnings, blocking}, implementing V1-V12 (WORLDSPEC.md §3).
  Bounds clamps (V9) are driven from the JSON Schema itself (one home for bounds),
  recorded as {path, submitted, applied}; >3 clamps warns. V2 clamps windows/peaks
  into the horizon; V3 swaps inverted spreads; V1/V4/V5/V6/V7/V8 warn on coherence;
  V10/V11 and custom-vintage-without-sleeves (V12) block. `validate` is pure (no wall
  clock); `stamp_validation` writes `provenance.validation` and flips draft→validated
  with a caller-supplied `validated_at`. 51 tests: one per rule, edge cases, and a
  table-driven sweep; canonical example is the clean baseline.
- **WP0.2 — WorldSpec models + loader.** pydantic v2 models mirroring
  `worldspec-v1.0.schema.json` exactly (required⇔required, `extra="forbid"`⇔
  `additionalProperties:false`, bounds/patterns/lengths). `load_worldspec(path|dict)`
  validates against the JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12) first, then constructs the model.
  Property test (hypothesis, 400 examples) asserts pydantic accepts ⇔ jsonschema
  accepts on fuzzed near-valid documents; canonical example round-trips identically.
  Narrative-blindness enforced structurally via a `NumericWorld` projection that
  omits `narrative`/`provenance`, plus a source-scan guard over engine/institution.
- **WP0.1 — Scaffold, tooling, CI.** Single-package `src/ah` layout; `pyproject.toml`
  pinned to Python 3.12 with the STEP0-PLAN §1 dependency set; uv workflow; ruff
  (lint+format), pyright (basic), pytest with `--disable-socket` (pytest-socket),
  coverage on `ah.core`; pre-commit hooks; GitHub Actions `ci.yml`
  (lint → typecheck → tests) with no network access; minimal `ah` CLI entry point.

### Contracts
- `worldspec 1.0.0` — vendored under `schemas/` (read-only): `worldspec-v1.0.schema.json`,
  `example-long-stagflation.worldspec.json`, `world-bible-v1.0.schema.json`, `WORLDSPEC.md`.
